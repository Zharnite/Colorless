I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "renpy/common/00start.rpy", line 203, in script call
    call _load_reload_game from _call__load_reload_game_1
  File "renpy/common/00keymap.rpy", line 446, in script
    python hide:
  File "renpy/common/00keymap.rpy", line 446, in <module>
    python hide:
  File "renpy/common/00keymap.rpy", line 456, in _execute_python_hide
    renpy.load("_reload-2")
Exception: Couldn't find a place to stop rolling back. Perhaps the script changed in an incompatible way?
